DevOps-Assignment

The assignment expects you to set up one click deploy and provisioning of an environment.

Create a RHEL based Vagrant Box (you can use CetnOS or SL), which can be used as template for creating multiple environments, using the vagrant box, implement the following

Using Puppet Install Tomcat and MySQL (MariaDB) and start it and deploy a sample application (WAR attached in mail) using Jenkins build pipeline into this Tomcat and run the application.

1.	Make a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline in Jenkins.
2.	On the VM automate following tasks using a provisioning tool of your choice:
a.	Install Tomcat and start it
b.	Install MySQL Server and start it
c.	Install Apache HTTPD
3.	Push the WAR using Jenkins build pipeline into the VM
4.	Also make sure that the location of tomcat and apache HTTPD should be flexible and controlled by puppet, in case no specific value is provided it should fall back to defaults


NOTES:

1.	You can make any assumptions and be as innovative and creative as possible
2.	You are expected to implement a CD pipeline with minimal use of shell scripts
3.	Check-in the complete project (cookbooks, manifests, Jenkins build definitions etc.) into a GitHub account and send us the repository location
4.	We will have a screen sharing call where you will have to demo the build-pipeline in Jenkins to show one click deployment (with provisioning)
5.	There should be minimal use of Shell Script in the over all pipeline
